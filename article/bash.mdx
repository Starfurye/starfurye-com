> Bash is the shell, or command language interpreter, for the gnu operating system. The name is an acronym for the _‘Bourne-Again SHell’_, a pun on Stephen Bourne, the author of the direct ancestor of the current Unix shell sh, which appeared in the Seventh Edition Bell Labs Research version of Unix.

## Introduction

### What is a shell?

At its base, a shell is simply a _macro processor_ that executes commands. The term macro processor means functionality where text and symbols are expanded to create larger expressions.

A Unix shell is both a command interpreter and a programming language.

Shells may be used interactively or non-interactively. In interactive mode, they accept input typed from the keyboard. When executing non-interactively, shells execute commands read from a file.

A shell allows execution of gnu commands, both synchronously and asynchronously. The shell waits for synchronous commands to complete before accepting more input; asynchronous commands continue to execute in parallel with the shell while it reads and executes additional commands. The _redirection_ constructs permit fine-grained control of the input and output of those commands. Moreover, the shell allows control over the contents of commands’ environments.

Shells also provide a small set of built-in commands (builtins) implementing functionality impossible or inconvenient to obtain via separate utilities. For example, `cd`, `break`, `continue`, and `exec` cannot be implemented outside of the shell because they directly manipulate the shell itself. The `history`, `getopts`, `kill`, or `pwd` builtins, among others, could be implemented in separate utilities, but they are more convenient to use as builtin commands. All of the shell builtins are described in subsequent sections.

Shell 提供了小部分内建功能，部分功能在其它程序中可能无法使用。比如：`cd`, `break`, `continue`, `exec` 不能在 shell 外部使用，因为它们使用的是 shell 本身；`history`, `getopts`, `kill`, `pwd` 则可以在别的程序中使用，但即便如此，在 shell 中使用他们会更加方便。

While executing commands is essential, most of the power (and complexity) of shells is due to their embedded programming languages. Like any high-level language, the shell provides variables, flow control constructs, quoting, and functions.
Shell 内嵌的编程语言非常强大，她提供了变量、控制流、引用和函数等高级语言具有的特性。

Shells offer features geared specifically for interactive use rather than to augment the programming language. These interactive features include job control, command line editing, command history and aliases.
相比作为一种编程语言，shell 多用于交互，她包括了工作控制、命令行编辑等特点。

Bash is primarily concerned with the Shell and Utilities portion of the posix 1003.1 standard.                                                                   |

It is a newline or one of the following: &#124;&#124;, &#38;&#38;;, &#38;, ;, ;;, ;&#38;, ;;&#38;, &#124;, &#124;                                                             | , (, or ). |

After expansion, when executing a command, the resulting fields are used as the command name and arguments.                                                    |

## Basic Shell Features 基本的 shell 特性

This chapter briefly summarizes the shell’s ‘building blocks’: commands, control structures, shell functions, shell parameters, shell expansions, redirections, which are a way to direct input and output from and to named files, and how the shell executes commands.

本章简要地介绍 shell 被用于向文件输入输出的内建模块：命令、控制结构、函数、参数、扩展和重定向，以及解释 shell 如何执行命令。

### Shell Syntax Shell 语法

When the shell reads input, it proceeds through a sequence of operations. If the input indicates the beginning of a comment, the shell ignores the comment symbol (‘#’), and the rest of that line.

Otherwise, roughly speaking, the shell reads its input and divides the input into words and operators, employing the quoting rules to select which meanings to assign various words and characters.

The shell then parses these tokens into commands and other constructs, removes the special meaning of certain words or characters, expands others, redirects input and output as needed, executes the specified command, waits for the command’s exit status, and makes that exit status available for further inspection or processing.

#### Shell Operation

The following is a brief description of the shell’s operation when it reads and executes a command. Basically, the shell does the following:

1. Reads its input from a file, from a string supplied as an argument to the -c invocation option, or from the user’s terminal.

2. Breaks the input into words and operators, obeying the quoting rules. These tokens are separated by metacharacters. Alias expansion is performed by this step.
3. Parses the tokens into simple and compound commands.
4. Performs the various shell expansions, breaking the expanded tokens into lists of filenames and commands and arguments.
5. Performs any necessary redirections and removes the redirection operators and their operands from the argument list.
6. Executes the command.
7. Optionally waits for the command to complete and collects its exit status.

#### Quoting 引用

Quoting is used to remove the special meaning of certain characters or words to the shell. Quoting can be used to disable special treatment for special characters, to prevent reserved words from being recognized as such, and to prevent parameter expansion.

引用常被用于消歧义，移除保留字的特殊意义（转义）等。

Each of the shell metacharacters has special meaning to the shell and must be quoted if it is to represent itself. When the command history expansion facilities are being used, the history expansion character, usually ‘!’, must be quoted to prevent history expansion.

shell 中有三种引用机制：反斜杠、单引号和双引号。

##### Escape Character 反斜杠

A non-quoted backslash ‘\’ is the Bash escape character. It preserves the literal value of the next character that follows, with the exception of newline. If a \newline pair appears, and the backslash itself is not quoted, the \newline is treated as a line continuation (that is, it is removed from the input stream and effectively ignored).

未引用的反斜杠将被用于转义，除了一种特殊情况：若反斜杠后跟换行符，将被视为该行的继续（也就是说，在输入流中，反斜杠会被移除）。

##### Single Quotes 单引号

Enclosing characters in single quotes (‘’’) preserves the literal value of each character within
the quotes. A single quote may not occur between single quotes, even when preceded by a
backslash.

##### Double Quotes 双引号

Enclosing characters in double quotes (‘`"`’) preserves the literal value of all characters within
the quotes, with the exception of ‘`$`’, ‘`‘`’, ‘`\`’, and, when history expansion is enabled, ‘`!`’.

-   When the shell is in `posix` mode, the ‘`!`’ has no special meaning within double quotes, even when history expansion is enabled.
-   The characters ‘`$`’ and ‘`‘`’ retain their special meaning within double quotes.
-   The backslash retains its special meaning only when followed by one of the following characters: ‘`$`’, ‘`‘`’, ‘`"`’, ‘`\`’, or `newline`. Within double quotes, backslashes that are followed by one of these characters are removed. Backslashes preceding characters without a special meaning are left unmodified.
-   A double quote may be quoted within double quotes by preceding it with a backslash. If enabled, history expansion will be performed unless an ‘`!`’ appearing in double quotes is escaped using a backslash. The backslash preceding the ‘`!`’ is not removed.
-   The special parameters ‘`*`’ and ‘`@`’ have special meaning when in double quotes, (see [Shell Parameter Expansion]).
